Easy rebuild Kernel/System with these Patches on armbian-buildsystem, or get the debs and install them to your prebuild downloaded from armbian.

Before booting for the first time pisound.dtbo should be moved from / boot / dtb / rockchip / overlay to the previously created / boot / overlay-user folder.
( you can also do it afterwards)
Then add the following entries in the file /boot/armbianEnv.txt
overlays = spi1
user_overlays = pisound

if your rockpi4 has onboard spi... i think this wonÂ´t work without changes because cs pin is then  not usable.
with some changes i also got response from nanopim4v2..... but you also have to take care about (re)wiring. to rockpi4 pisound is straight connectable on the header.
